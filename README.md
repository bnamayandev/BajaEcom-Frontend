# Baja E-Commerce Project


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Step 1: Collaboration Guidelines

We will use two repositories for this project:
- **Frontend**: [`bajaecom-frontend`](https://github.com/WesternBajaRacing/BajaEcom-Frontend)
- **Backend**: [`bajaecom-backend`](https://github.com/WesternBajaRacing/BajaEcom-Backend)


When contributing to the project, please follow these steps:

### 1.1 Fork the repository:
Each team member should first **fork** the repository by navigating to the repository page on GitHub and clicking the "Fork" button in the top right. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account. Make sure you deselect the checkbox that say "Only fork 'main' branch".

### 1.2 Clone your fork:
Once you've forked the repository, clone your copy to your local machine,
I would recommend having a folder titled "bajaecom" that has both the frontend and backend cloned inside. This allows you to seamlessly transition between the two during development.
You can clone like this:
```bash
cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECTS/
mkdir bajaecom
cd bajaecom
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bajaecom-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bajaecom-frontend.git
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Backend
Ensure that your terminal is in bajaecom-backend
```bash
cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECTS/bajaecom-backend
```
### 2.1 Create a '.env' folder
A dot env folder is used to store sensitive information, in this case, it holds the credentials to the postgres database.
Here is an example of how your .env file should look like:
```
# Database Configuration
DB_USER={USERNAME}
DB_PASSWORD={PASSWORD}
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT={DBPORT}
DB_NAME={DBNAME}

# Server Configuration
PORT={SERVERPORT}
```

### 2.2 Run Backend With Docker
You will have to run the backend with docker by running this command in your terminal.
```docker-compose up --build```

This will start both the PostgreSQL database and the backend server.

The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:13000 (based on the Docker ports configuration).

## Step 3: Set Up Frontend
Navigate to frontend from terminal
```bash
cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECTS/bajaecom-frontend
```
### 3.1 Install Dependencies 
run the following command to install all dependencies
```npm install```

### 3.2 Run Frontend
To start the frontend development server, run:
```npm start```
The frontend will now be available at http://localhost:3000.
